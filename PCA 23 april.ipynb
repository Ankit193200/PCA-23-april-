    "# Q2 How does the curse of dimensionality impact the performance of machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "Ans: As the dimensionality increases, the number of data points required for good performance of any machine learning algorithm increases exponentially. The reason is that, we would need more number of data points for any given combination of features, for any machine learning model to be valid."

    "# Q6: How does the curse of dimensionality relate to overfitting and underfitting in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans: Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "There is a relationship between ‘d’ and overfitting which is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "‘d’ is directly proportional to overfitting i.e. as the dimensionality increases the chances of overfitting also increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s discuss the solutions to tackle this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Model-dependent approach: Whenever we have a large number of features, we can always perform forward feature selection to determine the most relevant features for the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Unlike the above solution which is classification-oriented, we can also perform dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE which do not use the class labels to determine the most relevant features for the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is important to keep in mind whenever you download a new dataset that has a large number of features, you can reduce it by some of the techniques like PCA, t-SNE, or forward selection in order to ensure your model is not affected by the curse of dimensionality."
